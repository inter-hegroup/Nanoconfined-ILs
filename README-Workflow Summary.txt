System Setup
Design of confined ionic liquid (IL) systems within bilayer graphene oxide nanochannels (BLGOs) with 15 different interlayer distances (d) and 4 distinct ILs.
The system is designed to mimic confinement environments for studying gas separation properties.

Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations
Conducted to study the structure, interactions, and properties of the confined ionic liquid membranes (NC-ILMs).
Focused on the diffusion and solubility behaviors of four gas molecules (CO2, H2, CH4, and N2) in NC-ILMs.
Solvation-free energy analysis was performed to quantify gas solubility in NC-ILMs, revealing enhanced solubility compared to bulk ILs.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations
Performed to analyze the electrostatic properties of the ILs and gas molecules.
Calculated properties include dipole moment, polarizability, quadrupole moment et al., providing insights into the origin of enhanced solubility.

Feature Extraction and Machine Learning (ML) Analysis
Extracted 111 features across six categories from MD simulations, DFT calculations, and literature data.
Conducted ML analysis to identify key features influencing gas solubility, with the connecting angstrom cavity (CAC) emerging as the dominant factor.
These features and their correlations provide molecular-level insights into the mechanisms governing solubility in NC-ILMs.

Theoretical Model Development
Developed a theoretical framework combining dissolution and diffusion processes to predict CO2 separation performance.
The model achieved superior CO2 separation efficiency, overcoming the conventional selectivity-permeability trade-off.

Machine Learning for Solubility Prediction
Trained a machine learning model to predict gas solubility in NC-ILMs based on the identified key features.
The model provides a predictive tool for optimizing the design of NC-ILMs and guiding experimental efforts in carbon capture technologies.
